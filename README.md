# topview-garbagetruck-game

# This game is my first complex project with javascript. There are two goals with this project. Learn a lot about javascript, how it works, and what can i do with it. With the finished game our company wants to teach kids about waste management. Games are great to teach important things.

# The game is based on HTML5 Canvas. W3Schools helped a lot with Canvas and Javascript. For collision detection i used Separating Axis Theorem.
